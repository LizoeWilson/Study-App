# Study-App
This app is small beginner's project
It's an app designed to assist students with their studies.
Right now the app has three features: a timer, a to-do list, and the ability to add tasks to said list.
In future updates you will be able to: pause the timer, save your to-do list for later use, sort your list with different methods.
There will also be an update adding more visuals and a mascot for the app.
This is the very first program of my own creative creation since the demo of Stickmen the Stickman.
