# Study-App
This app is small beginner's project
It's an app designed to assist students with their studies.
It is far from finished and is updated periodically.
Right now the app has three features: a timer, a to-do list, and the ability to save and load to-do lists.
In future updates you will be able to: pause the timer, sort your list with different methods, and recieve reminders about tasks whose deadlines are fast approaching.
There will also be an update adding more visuals and a mascot for the app.
This is the very first program of my own creative creation since the demo of Stickmen the Stickman.
