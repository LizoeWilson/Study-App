				<p>Azaria Dunston has been programming on an off since she was in high school.
				   She has always been intrigued by the coding behind computers, apps, and devices.
				   Her very first original program was a demo for a video game called "Stickmen the Stickman."
				   Sadly, the code and assets for this game have been lost to time and computer 1's and 0's.
				   Her current goal is to build up experience and produce apps and video games as a real programmer under the name Zy.
