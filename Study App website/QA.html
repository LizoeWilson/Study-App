					<dt>Who is [Mascot]?</dt>
					<dd>
						[Mascot] is the face of the study app.
						He's a senior in high school who has a lot of homework, but finds working with others too be better than working alone.
						<br>His design is by Azaria. She was going for a simple easy-to-draw character to represent the app and give it personality.
